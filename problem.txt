Problem: This lab session focuses on the problem of weather prediction using RNNs based on a time-series dataset consisting of 500 daily weather records. Each record includes the date, temperature (°C), humidity (%), and rainfall (mm). The core problem is to model the temporal dependency among these variables in order to predict future weather conditions, particularly temperature, using past observations. Traditional feedforward models are inadequate for this task because they do not retain historical context. Therefore, an RNN-based approach is required to learn sequential patterns, seasonal variations, and short-term dependencies inherent in weather data. The challenge lies in achieving accurate predictions with a relatively small dataset while handling variability, noise, and non-linear relationships among weather parameters.
